BanglaAudiobook.in, is an effort to bring to life the literary treasures of বাংলা (_Bengali_). This started out as a small effort to record the audio versions of my favorite stories and novels for my siblings. Their lack of interest to read _Bengali_ literature and enjoy the stories I enjoyed as a child, pushed me to record the first _Bengali_ Audiobook.

Though there are other websites for obtaining bengali audiobooks, but either they are not updated regularly, or their collection excludes the most popular and favorite bengali stories/novels. This was also a push at my initial idea execution stage.

Many of you might be interested in the setup I use to record my voice. Here's the setup below:

1. [Apple 15" Macbook Pro](http://www.apple.com/in/macbook-pro/){:target="_blank"}
1. [Rode NTG2 Microphone](http://www.rode.com/microphones/ntg-2){:target="_blank"}
1. [Focusrite Scarlett Solo](https://focusrite.com/usb-audio-interface/scarlett/scarlett-solo){:target="_blank"}
1. [Philips BASS+ In-ear Headphones](https://www.philips.co.nz/c-p/SHE4305WT_00/bass-plus-headphones-with-mic){:target="_blank"}
1. [Apple Logic Pro X](http://www.apple.com/logic-pro/){:target="_blank"}

Also, I do not record in a sound-proof room. I just record in my room which has lot of soft surfaces, which dampens the sound.
